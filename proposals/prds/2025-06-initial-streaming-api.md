# Initial Streaming API Product Requirements

## Overview

This PRD defines the product requirements for implementing a real-time streaming API for markdown workspace synchronization. The API will enable applications to subscribe to document changes and receive real-time updates as markdown files are modified.

## Problem Statement

### Current State
Applications working with markdown workspaces lack real-time synchronization capabilities. They must implement their own file watching, change detection, and content parsing to stay current with workspace modifications.

### Target Users
- **Document search systems** that need to keep embeddings and indices up-to-date
- **Task management applications** that track tasks defined in markdown documents
- **Collaborative editing tools** that require real-time document synchronization
- **Note-taking applications** that need live updates across multiple clients

### User Pain Points
1. **Manual polling** required to detect document changes
2. **Complex file watching** logic needed for each application
3. **Inconsistent parsing** of markdown structure and metadata
4. **No standardized change notification** format across tools

## Success Criteria

### Primary Goals
- Applications can subscribe to document changes with minimal setup
- Real-time notifications delivered within 1 second of file changes
- Support for external file modifications (e.g., Obsidian, VS Code)
- Multiple concurrent subscribers receive consistent updates

### Success Metrics
- **Developer adoption**: Easy integration with < 10 lines of client code
- **Performance**: Handle workspaces with 1000+ documents efficiently
- **Reliability**: 99.9% event delivery success rate
- **Compatibility**: Works with existing markdown tools and editors

## User Requirements

### Primary Use Cases

**UC1: Document Search Indexing**
- As a search system developer
- I want to receive real-time document updates
- So that my search indices stay current without manual refresh

**UC2: Collaborative Document Viewing**
- As a documentation platform
- I want to show live document updates to viewers
- So that teams see the latest content immediately

### User Workflows

**Workflow 1: Subscribe to Workspace**
1. Application connects to streaming server
2. Sends subscription request for specific workspace
3. Receives initial document load events
4. Receives real-time change notifications
5. Processes updates and maintains local state

**Workflow 2: Handle External Changes**
1. User modifies markdown file in external editor
2. File system detects change
3. Server parses updated document
4. All subscribers receive change notification
5. Applications update their local representations

## Functional Requirements

### Core Features

**F1: Document Subscription**
- Subscribe to all documents within a workspace
- Receive subscription confirmation
- Get initial load of existing documents
- Receive initialization complete signal

**F2: Real-time Change Notifications**
- Detect file system changes automatically
- Parse updated document content and metadata
- Broadcast change events to all subscribers
- Handle document creation and deletion

**F3: Document Structure**
- Stream complete document metadata from frontmatter
- Include document ID and workspace information
- Support YAML frontmatter parsing
- Maintain document hierarchy information

**F4: Subscription Management**
- Client-controlled subscription IDs
- Graceful subscription cleanup on disconnect
- Multiple concurrent subscriptions per client
- Subscription lifecycle management

### Data Format

**Document Event Structure**
```
- Subscription ID (client-provided)
- Event type (Load, Change, Delete)
- Document data:
  - Unique document ID
  - Workspace name
  - Frontmatter metadata
  - Child node references
```

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance
- **Latency**: Change notifications within 1 second
- **Throughput**: Support 100+ concurrent subscribers
- **Scalability**: Handle workspaces with 1000+ documents
- **Memory**: Efficient memory usage for large workspaces

### Reliability
- **Availability**: 99.9% uptime during normal operation
- **Data consistency**: All subscribers eventually consistent
- **Error handling**: Graceful degradation on file system errors
- **Recovery**: Automatic reconnection support

### Compatibility
- **File formats**: Standard markdown with YAML frontmatter
- **External tools**: Work with Obsidian, VS Code, other editors
- **Operating systems**: Cross-platform file system monitoring
- **Network**: gRPC streaming over HTTP/2

## Success Metrics

### Launch Criteria
- [ ] Basic document subscription functionality working
- [ ] Real-time change detection from file system
- [ ] Multiple concurrent subscribers supported
- [ ] Complete test coverage for core workflows
- [ ] Documentation and examples available

### Post-Launch Metrics
- **Performance**: Average event delivery latency
- **Reliability**: Event delivery success rate
- **Usage**: Documents per workspace, subscribers per workspace

## Future Considerations

### Planned Enhancements
- Section-level subscriptions for granular updates
- Mutation capabilities for bidirectional editing
- Query interface for one-time document retrieval
- Advanced filtering and search capabilities

### Scalability Path
- Horizontal scaling for large deployments
- Event replay and history capabilities
- Performance optimizations for very large workspaces
- Clustering support for high availability

## Risks and Mitigations

### Technical Risks
- **File system performance**: Mitigate with efficient watching algorithms
- **Memory usage**: Implement streaming and pagination strategies
- **Event ordering**: Ensure consistent event delivery order

### Product Risks
- **Adoption barriers**: Provide clear documentation and examples
- **Performance expectations**: Set realistic latency and throughput targets
- **Compatibility issues**: Test with major markdown editors
