# [Feature Name] Product Requirements

## Overview

<!-- Brief summary of what this feature does and why it's needed -->
<!-- 2-3 sentences maximum -->

## Problem Statement

### Current State
<!-- Describe the current situation/pain points -->
<!-- What are users doing today? What's not working? -->

### Target Users
<!-- Who will use this feature? -->
<!-- - Primary users (main beneficiaries) -->
<!-- - Secondary users (indirect beneficiaries) -->
<!-- - Personas or user types -->

### User Pain Points
<!-- Specific problems users face today -->
<!-- Use numbered list for clarity -->
1. **Pain point 1**: Description
2. **Pain point 2**: Description
3. **Pain point 3**: Description

## Success Criteria

### Primary Goals
<!-- What does success look like? -->
<!-- Focus on user outcomes, not technical features -->

### Success Metrics
<!-- How will we measure success? -->
<!-- - Adoption metrics -->
<!-- - Performance metrics -->
<!-- - User satisfaction metrics -->
<!-- - Business metrics -->

## User Requirements

### Primary Use Cases

**UC1: [Use Case Name]**
- As a [user type]
- I want to [action/capability]
- So that [benefit/outcome]

**UC2: [Use Case Name]**
- As a [user type]
- I want to [action/capability]
- So that [benefit/outcome]

<!-- Add more use cases as needed -->

### User Workflows

**Workflow 1: [Workflow Name]**
1. User action/step
2. System response
3. User action/step
4. Expected outcome

**Workflow 2: [Workflow Name]**
1. User action/step
2. System response
3. User action/step
4. Expected outcome

<!-- Add more workflows as needed -->

## Functional Requirements

### Core Features

**F1: [Feature Name]**
<!-- Description of what this feature does -->
<!-- Key capabilities and behaviors -->
<!-- Input/output expectations -->

**F2: [Feature Name]**
<!-- Description of what this feature does -->
<!-- Key capabilities and behaviors -->
<!-- Input/output expectations -->

<!-- Add more features as needed -->

### Data Format

<!-- If applicable, describe data structures, APIs, or formats -->
**[Data Structure Name]**
```
- Field 1: Description
- Field 2: Description
- Field 3: Description
```

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance
<!-- Latency, throughput, scalability requirements -->
<!-- Be specific with numbers where possible -->
- **Latency**: Target response times
- **Throughput**: Concurrent users/requests
- **Scalability**: Growth expectations

### Reliability
<!-- Availability, data consistency, error handling -->
- **Availability**: Uptime requirements
- **Data consistency**: Consistency guarantees
- **Error handling**: Failure scenarios

### Compatibility
<!-- Integration requirements, backward compatibility -->
- **Platforms**: Supported platforms/environments
- **Integration**: External systems/tools
- **Backward compatibility**: Legacy support needs

## Technical Constraints

### Platform Requirements
<!-- Technology stack, dependencies, infrastructure -->

### Integration Constraints
<!-- Existing systems that must be supported -->
<!-- APIs or protocols that must be used -->

## Success Metrics

### Launch Criteria
<!-- What must be true before we can launch? -->
- [ ] Core functionality implemented and tested
- [ ] Performance requirements met
- [ ] Documentation complete
- [ ] User acceptance testing passed

### Post-Launch Metrics
<!-- How will we track ongoing success? -->
- **Performance**: [Specific metrics like latency, throughput]
- **Reliability**: [Specific metrics like uptime, error rates]
- **Usage**: [Specific metrics like adoption, volume]

## Future Considerations

### Planned Enhancements
<!-- Known future features or improvements -->
<!-- Features that are out of scope for this release -->

### Scalability Path

## Template Usage Notes

### When to Use This Template
- For new features or significant changes
- When multiple teams/stakeholders are involved
- For features that impact user experience
- When clear requirements definition is needed

### How to Fill Out This Template
1. **Start with Overview**: One clear sentence about what you're building
2. **Define the Problem**: Be specific about current pain points
3. **Identify Users**: Know exactly who will benefit
4. **Write Use Cases**: Use "As a... I want... So that..." format
5. **Be Specific**: Include concrete numbers for performance/success metrics
6. **Think Future**: Consider how this fits into long-term vision
7. **Link Documents**: Always cross-reference with design docs

### Tips for Good PRDs
- **User-focused**: Start with user needs, not technical solutions
- **Measurable**: Include specific success criteria and metrics
- **Prioritized**: Distinguish between must-have and nice-to-have features
- **Realistic**: Set achievable goals and timelines
- **Collaborative**: Involve stakeholders in the writing process
